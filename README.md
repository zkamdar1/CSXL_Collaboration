# CS Experience Lab Project @ UNC Chapel Hill

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the CS Experience Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The focus was on using Agile methodologies to collaborate effectively in small teams and contribute to an evolving open-source project. We initially worked on a Pomodoro timer feature and later expanded the project with a news feature.

## Project Features

### 1. Pomodoro Timer Feature

- **Team Size:** 2 members
- **Objective:** Implement a Pomodoro timer to help users manage their work and break intervals efficiently.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Agile Practices:** We used a modified Agile approach, breaking our tasks into small, manageable user stories and completing them in 1-week sprints. We conducted daily stand-ups to align on progress and blockers.

### 2. News Feature

- **Team Size:** 4 members
- **Objective:** Develop a news aggregation feature that provides users with the latest articles and updates.
- **Technologies Used:** React, API integration for news sources
- **Agile Practices:** We continued to use Agile methods, working in 2-week sprints. Our workflow included:
  - **Sprint Planning:** Defined sprint goals, prioritized backlog items, and assigned tasks.
  - **Daily Stand-ups:** Short meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
  - **Code Reviews:** Implemented a pull request process to ensure code quality. Each pull request was reviewed by at least one team member before being merged.
  - **Retrospectives:** At the end of each sprint, we held a retrospective to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how we could enhance our processes for the next sprint.

## Challenges and Learning

- **Version Control:** Managing multiple branches and ensuring smooth merges was a critical part of our workflow. We used Git extensively, adhering to best practices for branching and committing.
- **Collaboration:** Working in teams of varying sizes taught us the importance of clear communication, both in documenting code and in discussing tasks and progress.
- **Agile Adaptation:** Adapting Agile principles to our projectâ€™s needs allowed us to be flexible and responsive to changes. We learned to prioritize tasks effectively and to deliver functional increments regularly.

## Important Note

The underlying open-source repository for this project has been updated and changed since the completion of our assignment. As a result, the original features (Pomodoro timer and news aggregation) are no longer live, and access to the original codebase is restricted. This README serves to document the work and experience gained during the project, showcasing our commitment to collaboration, Agile methodologies, and software development best practices.

## Team Contributions

- **Sprint 1 (Pomodoro Timer):** Designed the user interface and implemented the core timer functionality.
- **Sprint 2 (Pomodoro Timer Enhancement):** Added custom interval settings and visual cues for work/break periods.
- **Sprints 3-4 (News Feature):** Integrated news API, created a dynamic UI for displaying articles, and implemented filtering options.
- **Sprint 5 (Refinement and Testing):** Conducted thorough testing, fixed bugs, and optimized performance.
